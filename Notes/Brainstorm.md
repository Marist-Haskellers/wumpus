# Brainstorming and Planning

## Data Representation

### What data must we represent?

- player
-- where is the player?
-- how many arrows?
-- currently active sense?

- cave
-- how can tell rooms apart? (unique identifier?)
-- attribute/contents (empty/normal, pit, bats, wumpus)
-- should we store the "sense result" as data with each cave?

## Functions and Classes

### What operations/transformations do we need?

- outcome/result of a threat (e.g., bats, pit, wumpus)
- three senses
-- should we compute the result of a sense from other data?
